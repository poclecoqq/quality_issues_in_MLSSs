# Quality issues in Machine Learning Software Systems

This Replication Package is intended for replication of results presented in the paper "Quality issues in Machine Learning Software Systems" that has been submitted as a registered report to International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME 2022) and later submitted to Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE) journal. It contains the data, artifacts, and code used in the paper. Any use of the material provided in this code repository must cite the paper.

Our replication package consists of two folders: `interviews` and `utils`. Below, we briefly describe the folders. A more detailed description is given in the `README.md` files present in each folder. 



## `interviews`
This folder contains:
- the old and new interview guide
- the transcripts
- the coded transcripts


## `utils`
